# CO2-Tracker

This is my capstone project for my undergraduate degree at Westminster College.

# Report

This report presents the process and results of developing a Swift CO2 tracker application over the last 5 months. The application is designed to enable users to monitor their carbon footprint and make more environmentally friendly decisions. The project involved the development and integration of several modules, including data input, CO2 calculation, data visualization, and user account management. The results indicate that the application successfully performs its intended functions, offering significant potential for user engagement and environmental awareness.
## Introduction
The project undertaken was the development of a Swift-based CO2 tracker application, a tool aimed to help users monitor and reduce their carbon footprint. The initiative was motivated by the global challenge of climate change and the need for individuals to understand and reduce their personal contribution to CO2 emissions. The application was designed to be user-friendly and educational, providing real-time feedback on CO2 emissions based on user activities. This project aligns with the broader field of computing by leveraging technology to solve complex, real-world issues, specifically in the domain of environmental conservation.
## Background
The CO2 tracking application landscape is growing, with several apps such as Oroeco, JouleBug, and My Planet already in existence. These applications provide varying degrees of carbon tracking capabilities, from simple calculators to comprehensive lifestyle tracking. The CO2 tracker app sets itself apart by offering a simple, intuitive interface coupled with robust tracking and analytical capabilities. It provides comprehensive tracking across various activities, including transportation, and domestic energy use.
## Methods
The development process started with gathering requirements and setting objectives for the application. The Swift programming language was used for the entire application development process due to its safety, speed, and interactive nature. Technologies and APIs utilized include
Core Data for persistent data storage, SwiftUI for UI design and MapKit for the different maps displayed in the app.
The application's primary components include a data input module, a CO2 calculation module, a data visualization module, and a user account management module. Each module was developed independently and then integrated to create the final application. During the development process, various challenges were encountered, such as the need to optimize data storage and retrieval, or showing the correct information for each record.
 
## Results
The final CO2 tracker application successfully incorporated all desired features and functionalities, even though not in an automated way as planned. Users can input data related to their daily activities, which is then calculated to estimate their CO2 emissions. The application provides a comprehensive overview of the user's carbon footprint, visualizing the data in easy-to-understand graphs and charts.

## Discussion
The capstone project aimed to deliver a comprehensive CO2 tracking application that would facilitate users in understanding and reducing their carbon footprint. The project allowed for the exploration and understanding of various technical aspects, including Swift programming, and persistent data storage mechanisms.
The project also presented valuable lessons in project management, particularly in terms of time allocation and managing roadblocks. Unexpected challenges such as the need to switch data storage types required a fast response and flexibility. The success of the project under such circumstances highlights the importance of adaptability and problem-solving skills in software development.

## Conclusions
The final CO2 tracker application met the initial project objectives, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for tracking and reducing CO2 emissions. However, if given more time, potential additions could include the integration of a wider range of APIs to increase the accuracy of emission calculations, and the development of a community feature to encourage users to engage with each other and foster a sense of shared responsibility towards carbon footprint reduction.
The CO2 tracker app stands as a testament to the potential of leveraging technology to create practical solutions for complex global challenges. It embodies the idea that while individual contributions to carbon emissions may seem small, collective action driven by awareness can have a profound impact on our environment. Future work could also focus on refining the machine learning algorithms for more personalized suggestions and implementing push notifications to regularly remind users of their progress and tips for further reducing their carbon footprint.
